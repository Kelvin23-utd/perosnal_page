                                I am Xiao Yan, a PhD student in Computer Science (Systems Track) at the University of Texas at Dallas. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Birmingham in 2022, and my master's degree in Applied Computational Science & Engineering from Imperial College London in 2023.
                            </p>

                                My research interests focus on large language model (LLM) applications for mobile and cyber-physical systems, with particular emphasis on efficiency evaluation and optimization for resource-constrained devices. I'm also interested in affective computing, deep learning, and parallel programming.

                                Currently, I'm conducting research on LLM deployment strategies across mobile, edge, and cloud platforms. My recent paper "Are We There Yet? A Measurement Study of Efficiency for LLM Applications on Mobile Devices" has been accepted at the 2nd International Workshop on Foundation Models for Cyber-Physical Systems & Internet of Things (FMSys '25).
